Hello! Welcome to the repo for the HOBO data and python scripting related to research done in the HJA Andrews Experimental Forest by Todd R. Lookingbill, Jack DuPuy, Ellery Jacobs, Matteo Gonzalez, and Tihomir S. Kostadinov completed in 2022.

Important things to keep in mind:
1) For any data-related questions, please feel free to reach out to Jack DuPuy or Todd Lookingbill.
2) A masterscript is in development such that any HOBO data can be analyzed using the same methods we did regardless of start time/season.
3) For now, I've included an example folder where you can see results for all 2022 HOBOs with a 00:36 start time, examine the scripts that created those results, and run the scripts yourself on 3 example HOBO csv files.
