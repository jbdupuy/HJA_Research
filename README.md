Hello! Welcome to the repo for the original data and python scripting related to research done in the HJA Andrews Experimental Forest associated with the paper: 
Lookingbill, T.R.; DuPuy, J.; Jacobs, E.; Gonzalez, M.; Kostadinov, T.S. A 20-Year Ecotone Study of Pacific Northwest Mountain Forest Vulnerability to Changing Snow Conditions. 
Land 2024, 13(4), 424. https://doi.org/10.3390/land13040424


Important things to keep in mind:
1) For any data-related questions, please feel free to reach out to Jack DuPuy (jack.dupuy@richmond.edu) or Todd Lookingbill (tlooking@richmond.edu).
2) A masterscript is in development such that any HOBO data can be analyzed using the same methods we did regardless of start time/season.
3) For now, I've included an example folder where you can see results for all 2022 HOBOs with a 00:36 start time, examine the scripts that created those results, and run the scripts yourself on 3 example HOBO csv files.
